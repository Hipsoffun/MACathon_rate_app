# Description
The app is designed to allow users to create ratings for ANYTHING, from past units youâ€™ve to your favourite study spots, you can rate it and see others opinions. Simply create a rating for a concept or a location, and post. This encourages people to post as there is less emphasis on the original poster as we focus on the community aspect of the average rating and the conversations within the comment sections. The app also includes an AR feature, which allows users to scan their surroundings to see nearby ratings.
